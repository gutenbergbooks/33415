ACT I
</h2>
<p>
<i>The hall of EARTH-SPIRIT</i>, Act <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>, <i>feebly lighted
by an oil lamp on the centre table. Even this is dimmed
by a heavy shade. Lulu's picture is gone from the easel,
which still stands by the foot of the stairs. The fire-screen
and the chair by the ottoman are gone too. Down
left is a small tea-table, with a coffee-pot and a cup of
black coffee on it, and an arm-chair next it.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>In this chair, deep in cushions, with a plaid shawl over
her knees, sits Countess Geschwitz in a tight black dress.
Rodrigo, clad as a servant, sits on the ottoman. At the
rear, Alva Sch&ouml;n is walking up and down before the
entrance door.</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> He lets people wait for him as if he were
a concert conductor!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> I beg of you, don't speak!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Hold my tongue, with a head as full of
thoughts as mine is!&mdash;I absolutely can't believe she's
changed so awfully much to her advantage there!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> She is more glorious to look at than I
have ever seen her!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> God preserve me from founding my life-happiness
on your taste and judgment! If the sickness has
hit her as it has you, I'm smashed and thru! You're
leaving the contagious ward like an acrobat-lady who's
had an accident after giving herself up to art. You can
scarcely blow your nose any more. First you need a
quarter-hour to sort your fingers, and then you have to
be mighty careful not to break off the tip.
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> What puts <span class="gesperrt">us</span> under the ground gives
<span class="gesperrt">her</span> health and strength again.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> That's all right and fine enough. But I
don't think I'll be travelling off with her this evening.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> You will let your bride journey all alone,
after all?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> In the first place, the old fellow's going with
her to protect her in case anything serious&mdash;. My escort
could only be suspicious. And secondly, I must wait
here till my costumes are ready. I'll get across the
frontier soon enough alright,&mdash;and I hope in the meantime
she'll put on a little embonpoint, too. Then we'll
get married, provided I can present her before a respectable
public. I love the practical in a woman: what
theories they make up for themselves are all the same
to me. Aren't they to you too, doctor?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I haven't heard what you were saying.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I'd never have got my person mixed up in
this plot if she hadn't kept tickling my bare pate, before
her sentence. If only she doesn't start doing too much
as soon as she's out of Germany! I'd like best to take
her to London for six months, and let her fill up on
plum-cakes. In London one expands just from the sea
air. And then, too, in London one doesn't feel with every
swallow of beer as if the hand of fate were at one's
throat.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I've been asking myself for a week whether a
person who'd been sentenced to prison could still be
made to go as the chief figure in a modern drama.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> If the man would only come, now!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I've still got to redeem my properties out
of the pawn-shop here, too. Six hundred kilos of the
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
best iron. The baggage-rate on 'em is always three times
as much as my own ticket, so that the whole junket
isn't worth a trowser's button. When I went into the
pawn-shop with 'em, dripping with sweat, they asked me
if the things were genuine!&mdash;I'd have really done better
to have had the costumes made abroad. In Paris, for
instance, they see at the first glance where one's best points
are, and bravely lay them bare. But you can't learn that
with bow-legs; it's got to be studied on classically shaped
people. In this country they're as scared of naked
skin as they are abroad of dynamite bombs. A couple
of years ago I was fined fifty marks at the Alhambra
Theater, because people could see I had a few hairs on
my chest, not enough to make a respectable tooth-brush!
But the Fine Arts Minister opined that the little school-girls
might lose their joy in knitting stockings because
of it; and since then I have myself shaved once a month.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> If I didn't need every bit of my creative power
now for the &ldquo;World-conqueror,&rdquo; I might like to test the
problem and see what could be done with it. That's the
curse of our young literature: we're so much too literary.
We know only such questions and problems as come up
among writers and cultured people. We cannot see beyond
the limits of our own professional interests. In
order to get back on the trail of a great and powerful art
we must move as much as possible among men who've
never read a book in their lives, whom the simplest animal
instincts direct in all they do. I've tried already, with
all my might, to work according to those principles&mdash;in
my &ldquo;Earth-spirit.&rdquo; The woman who was my model for
the chief figure in that, breathes to-day&mdash;and has for a
year&mdash;behind barred windows; and on that account for
some incomprehensible reason the play was only brought
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
to performance by the Society for Free Literature. As
long as my father was alive, all the stages of Germany
stood open to my creations. That has been vastly changed.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I've had a pair of tights made of the tenderest
blue-green. If <span class="gesperrt">they</span> don't make a success abroad, I'll
sell mouse-traps! The trunks are so delicate I can't sit
on the edge of a table in 'em. The only thing that will
disturb the good impression is my awful bald head, which
I owe to my active participation in this great conspiracy.
To lie in the hospital in perfect health for three months
would make a fat pig of the most run-down old hobo.
Since coming out I've fed on nothing but Karlsbad pills.
Day and night I have orchestra rehearsals in my intestines.
I'll be so washed out before I get across the frontier
that I won't be able to lift a bottle-cork.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> How the attendants in the hospital got
out of her way yesterday! That was a refreshing sight.
The garden was still as the grave: in the loveliest noon
sunlight the convalescents didn't venture out of doors.
Away back by the contagious ward she stepped out under
the mulberry trees and swayed on her ankles on the
gravel. The door-keeper had recognized me, and a young
doctor who met me in the corridor shrunk up as tho a
revolver shot had struck him. The Sisters vanished into
the big rooms or stayed stuck against the walls. When
I came back there was not a soul to be seen in the garden
or at the gate. No better chance could have been
found, if we had had the curs&eacute;d passports. And now the
fellow says he isn't going with her!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I understand the poor hospital-brothers.
One has a bad foot and another has a swollen cheek, and
there appears in the midst of them the incarnate death-insurance-agentess!
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
In the Hall of the Knights, as the
blessed division was called from which I organized my
spying, when the news got around there that Sister Theophila
had departed this life, not one of the fellows could
be kept in bed. They scrambled up to the window-bars,
if they had to drag their pains along with them by the
hundred-weight. I never heard such swearing in my life!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Allow me, Fr&auml;ulein von Geschwitz, to come
back to my proposition once more. Tho my father was
shot in this room, still I can see in the murder, as in
the punishment, nothing but a horrible misfortune that has
befallen <span class="gesperrt">her</span>; nor do I think that my father, if he had
come through alive, would have withdrawn his support
from her entirely. Whether your plan for freeing her
will succeed still seems to me very doubtful, tho I
wouldn't like to discourage you; but I can find no words
to express the admiration with which your self-sacrifice,
your energy, your superhuman scorn of death, inspires
me. I don't believe any man ever risked so much for
a woman, let alone for a friend. I am not aware,
Fr&auml;ulein von Geschwitz, how rich you are, but the expenses
for what you have accomplished must have exhausted
your fortune. May I venture to offer you a
loan of 20,000 marks&mdash;which I should have no trouble
raising for you in cash?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> How we did rejoice when Sister Theophila
was really dead! From that day on we were free
from custody. We changed our beds as we liked. I
had done my hair like hers, and copied every tone of her
voice. When the professor came he called <span class="gesperrt">her</span> &ldquo;gn&auml;diges
Fr&auml;ulein&rdquo; and said to me, &ldquo;It's better living here than
in prison!&rdquo;... When the Sister suddenly was missing,
we looked at each other in suspense: we had both been
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
sick five days: now was the deciding moment. Next
morning came the assistant.&mdash;&ldquo;How is Sister Theophila?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;&mdash;We
communicated behind his back, and
when he had gone we sank in each other's arms: &ldquo;God
be thanked! God be thanked!&rdquo;&mdash;What pains it cost me
to keep my darling from betraying how well she already
was! &ldquo;You have nine years of prison before you,&rdquo; I
cried to her early and late. Now they probably won't
let her stay in the contagious ward three days more!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I lay in the hospital full three months to
spy out the ground, after toilfully peddling together the
qualities necessary for such a long stay. Now I act the
valet here with you, Dr. Sch&ouml;n, so that no strange servants
may come into the house. Where is the bridegroom
who's ever done so much for his bride? <span class="gesperrt">My</span>
fortune has also been destroyed.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> When you succeed in developing her into a
respectable artiste you will have put the world in debt
to you. With the temperament and the beauty that she
has to give out of the depths of her nature she can make
the most blas&eacute; public hold its breath. And then, too,
she will be protected by <span class="gesperrt">acting</span> passion from a second
time becoming a criminal in reality.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I'll soon drive her kiddishness out of her!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> There he comes! (<i>Steps louden in the
gallery. Then the curtains part at the head of the stairs
and Schigolch in a long black coat with a white sun-shade
in his right hand comes down. Thruout the play his
speech is interrupted with frequent yawns.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Confound the darkness! Out-doors the
sun burns your eyes out.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Wearily unwrapping herself.</i>) I'm
coming!
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Her ladyship has seen no daylight for three
days. We live here like in a snuff-box.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Since nine o'clock this morning I've been
round to all the old-clothes-men. Three brand new
trunks stuffed full of old trowsers I've expressed to
Buenos Ayres via Bremerhaven. My legs are dangling
on me like the tongue of a bell. That's the new life it's
going to be from now on!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Where are you going to get off to-morrow
morning?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I hope not straight into Ox-butter Hotel
again!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I can tell you a fine hotel. I lived there
with a lady lion-tamer. The people were born in Berlin.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Upright in the arm-chair.</i>) Come and
help me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Hurries to her and supports her.</i>) And
you'll be safer from the police there than on a high tightrope!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> He means to let you go with her alone
this afternoon.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Maybe he's still suffering from his chillblains!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Do you want me to start my new engagement
in bath-robe and slippers?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Hm&mdash;Sister Theophila wouldn't have
gone to heaven so promptly either, if she hadn't felt so
affectionate towards our patient.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span>. She'll have a different value when one must
serve thru a honeymoon with her. Anyway, it can't hurt
her if she gets a little fresh air beforehand.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>A pocketbook in his hand, to Geschwitz who</i>
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
<i>is leaning on a chair-back by the centre table.</i>) This
holds 10,000 marks.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Thank you, no.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Please take it.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>To Schigolch.</i>) Come along, at last!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Patience, Fr&auml;ulein. It's only a stone's
throw across Hospital Street. I'll be here with her in
five minutes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You're bringing her here?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I'm bringing her here. Or do you fear
for your health?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You see that I fear nothing.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> According to the latest wire, the doctor is
on his way to Constantinople to have his &ldquo;Earth-spirit&rdquo;
produced before the Sultan by harem-ladies and eunuchs.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Opening the centre door under the gallery.</i>)
It's shorter for you thru here. (<i>Exeunt Schigolch and
Countess Geschwitz. Alva locks the door.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> You were going to give more money to the
crazy sky-rocket!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> What has that to do with you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I get paid like a lamp-lighter, tho I had to
demoralize all the Sisters in the hospital. Then came the
assistants' and the doctors' turn, and then&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Will you seriously inform me that the medical
professors let themselves be influenced by you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> With the money those gentlemen cost me
I could become President of the United States!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> But Fr&auml;ulein von Geschwitz has reimbursed
you for every penny that you spent. So far as I know
you're getting a monthly salary of five hundred marks
from her besides. It is often pretty hard to believe in
your love for the unhappy murderess. When I asked
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Fr&auml;ulein von Geschwitz just now to accept my help, it
certainly was not to incite your insatiable avarice. The
admiration which I have learnt to have for Fr&auml;ulein von
Geschwitz in this affair, I am far from feeling towards
you. It is not at all clear to me what claims of any kind
you can make upon me. That you chanced to be present
at the murder of my father has not yet created the slightest
bond of relationship between you and me. On the
contrary, I am firmly convinced that if the heroic undertaking
of Countess Geschwitz had not come your way you
would be lying somewhere to-day without a penny,
drunken in the gutter.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> And do you know what would have become
of you if you hadn't sold for two millions the tuppeny
paper your father ran? You'd have hitched up with
the stringiest sort of ballet-girl and been to-day a stable-boy
in the Humpelmeier Circus. What work do you do?
You've written a drama of horrors in which my bride's
calves are the two chief figures and which no high-class
theater will produce. You walking pajamas! You fresh
rag-bag you! Two years ago I balanced two saddled
cavalry-horses on this chest. How that'll go now, after
this (<i>clasping his bald head</i>), is a question sure enough.
The foreign girls will get a fine idea of German art
when they see the sweat come beading thru my tights at
every fresh kilo-weight! I shall make the whole auditorium
stink with my exhalations!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You're weak as a dish-clout!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Would to God you were right! or did you
perhaps intend to insult me? If so, I'll set the tip of
my toe to your jaw so that your tongue'll crawl along
the carpet over there!
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Try it! (<i>Steps and voices outside.</i>) Who
is that...?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> You can thank God that I have no public
here before me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Who can that be!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> That is my beloved. It's a full year now
since we've seen each other.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> But how should they be back already! Who
can be coming there? I expect no one.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Oh the devil, unlock it!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Hide yourself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I'll get behind the porti&egrave;res. I've stood there
once before, a year ago. (<i>Disappears, right. Alva opens
the rear door, whereupon Alfred Hugenberg enters, hat
in hand.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> With whom have I&mdash;.... You? Aren't
you&mdash;?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> Alfred Hugenberg.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> What can I do for you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> I've come from M&uuml;nsterburg. I ran
away this morning.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> My eyes are bad. I am forced to keep the
blinds closed.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> I need your help. You will not refuse
me. I've got a plan ready. Can anyone hear us?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> What do you mean? What sort of a plan?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> Are you alone?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Yes. What do you want to impart to me?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> I've had two plans already that I let
drop. What I shall tell you now has been worked out
to the last possible chance. If I had money I should
not confide it to you; I thought about that a long time
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
before coming.... Will you not permit me to set forth
to you my design?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Will you kindly tell me just what you are talking about?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> She cannot possibly be so indifferent to
you that I must tell you that. The evidence <span class="gesperrt">you</span> gave
the coroner helped her more than everything the defending
counsel said.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I beg to decline the supposition.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> You would say that; I understand that,
of course. But all the same you were her best witness.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> <span class="gesperrt">You</span> were! You said my father was about
to force her to shoot herself.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> He was, too. But they didn't believe
me. I wasn't put on my oath.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Where have you come from now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> From a reform-school I broke out of
this morning.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> And what do you have in view?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> I'm trying to get into the confidence of
a turnkey.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> What do you mean to live on?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> I'm living with a girl who's had a child
by my father.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Who is your father?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> He's a police captain. I know the
prison without ever having been inside it; and nobody in
it will recognize me as I am now. But I don't count
on that at all. I know an iron ladder by which one can
get from the first court to the roof and thru an opening
there into the attic. There's no way up to it from inside.
But in all five wings boards and laths and great heaps
of shavings are lying under the roofs, and I'll drag them
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
all together in the middle and set fire to them. My
pockets are full of matches and all the things used to
make fires.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> But then you'll burn up there!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> Of course, if I'm not rescued. But to
get into the first court I must have the turnkey in my
power, and for that I need money. Not that I mean
to bribe him; that wouldn't go. I must lend him money
to send his three children to the country, and then at
four o'clock in the morning when the prisoners of respected
families are discharged, I'll slip in the door. He'll
lock-up behind me and ask me what I'm after, and I'll
ask him to let me out again in the evening. And before
it gets light, I'm up in the attic.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> How did you escape from the reform-school?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> Jumped out the window. I need two
hundred marks for the rascal to send his family to the
country.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Stepping out of the porti&egrave;res, right.</i>) Will
the Herr Baron have coffee in the music-room or on the
veranda?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> Where does that man come from?
Out of the same door! He jumped out of the same
door!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I've taken him into my service. He is dependable.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> (<i>Grasping his temples.</i>) Fool that I
am! Oh, fool!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Oh, yah, we've seen each other here before!
Cut away now to your vice-mamma. Your kid brother
might like to uncle his brothers and sisters. Make your
sir-papa the grandfather of his children! You're the only
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
thing we've missed. If you once get into my sight in the
next two weeks, I'll beat your bean up for porridge.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Be quiet, you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> I'm a fool!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> What do you want to do with your fire?
Don't you know the lady's been dead three weeks?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> Did they cut off her head?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> No, she's got that still. She was mashed by
the cholera.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> That is not true!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> What do you know about it! There, read
it: here! (<i>Taking out a paper and pointing to the place.</i>)
&ldquo;The murderess of Dr. Sch&ouml;n....&rdquo; (<i>Gives Hugenberg
the paper. He reads:</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> &ldquo;The murderess of Dr. Sch&ouml;n has in
some incomprehensible way fallen ill of the cholera in
prison.&rdquo; It doesn't say that she's dead.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Well, what else do you suppose she is? She's
been lying in the churchyard three weeks. Back in the
left-hand corner behind the rubbish-heap where the little
crosses are with no names on them, there she lies under
the first one. You'll know the spot because the grass
hasn't grown on it. Hang a tin wreath there, and then
get back to your nursery-school or I'll denounce you to
the police. I know the female that beguiles her leisure
hours with you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> (<i>To Alva.</i>) Is it true that she's dead?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Thank God, yes!&mdash;Please, do not keep me here
any longer. My doctor has forbidden me to receive
visitors.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> My future is worth so little now! I
would gladly have given the last scrap of what life is
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
worth to me for her happiness. Heigh-ho! One way
or another I'll sure go to the devil now!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> If you dare in any way to approach me or the
doctor here or my honorable friend Schigolch too near,
I'll inform on you for intended arson. You need three
good years, to learn where not to stick your fingers in!
Now get out!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HUGENBERG.</span> Fool!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Get out!! (<i>Throws him out the door.
Coming down.</i>) I wonder you didn't put your purse at
that rogue's disposal, too!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I won't stand your damned jabbering! The
boy's little finger is worth more than all you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I've had enough of this Geschwitz's company!
If my bride is to become a corporation with limited
liability, somebody else can go in ahead of me. I propose
to make a magnificent trapeze-artist out of her, and
willingly risk my life to do it. But then I'll be master
of the house, and will myself indicate what cavaliers she
is to receive!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> The boy has what our age lacks: a hero-nature;
therefore, of course, he is going to ruin. Do you remember
how before sentence was passed he jumped out of the
witness-box and yelled at the justice: &ldquo;How do you know
what would have become of you if you'd had to run
around the caf&eacute;s barefoot every night when you were ten
years old?!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> If I could only have given him one in the
jaw for that right away! Thank God, there are jails
where scum like that gets some respect for the law pounded
into them.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> One like him might have been my model for
my &ldquo;World-conqueror.&rdquo; For twenty years literature has
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
presented nothing but demi-men: men who can beget no
children and women who can bear none. That's called
&ldquo;The Modern Problem.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I've ordered a hippopotamus-whip two inches
thick. If that has no success with her, you can
fill my cranium with potato-soup. Be it love or be it
whipping, female flesh never inquires. Only give it some
amusement, and it stays firm and fresh. She is now in
her twentieth year, has been married three times and has
satisfied a gigantic horde of lovers, and her heart's desires
are at last pretty plain. But the man's got to have the
seven deadly sins on his forehead, or she honors him not.
If he looks as if a dog-catcher had spat him out on the
street, then, with such women-folks, he needn't be afraid
of a prince! I'll rent a garage fifty feet high and break
her in there; and when she's learnt the first diving-leap
without breaking her neck I'll pull on a black coat and
not stir a finger the rest of my life. When she's educated
practically it doesn't cost a woman half as much trouble
to support her husband as the other way round, if only
the man takes care of the mental labor for her, and doesn't
let the sense of the family go to wreck.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I have learnt to rule humanity and drive it in
harness before me like a well-broken four-in-hand,&mdash;but
that boy sticks in my head. Really, I can still take private
lessons in the scorn of the world from that school-boy!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> She'll just comfortably let her hide be papered
with thousand-mark bills! I'll extract salaries out
of the directors with a centrifugal pump. I know their
kind. When they don't need a man, let him shine their
shoes for them; but when they must have an artiste they
cut her down from the very gallows with their own hands
and with the most entangling compliments.
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> In my situation there's nothing more in the
world to fear&mdash;but death. In the realm of sensation I
am the poorest beggar. But I can no longer scrape up
the moral courage to exchange my established position for
the excitements of the wild, adventurous life!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> She had sent Papa Schigolch and me together
in chase of some strong antidote for sleeplessness.
We each got a twenty-mark piece for expenses. There
we see the youngster sitting in the Night-light Caf&eacute;. He
was sitting like a criminal on the prisoner's bench. Schigolch
sniffed at him from all sides, and remarked, &ldquo;He is
still virgin.&rdquo; (<i>Up in the gallery, dragging steps are
heard.</i>) There she is! The future magnificent trapeze-artiste
of the present age!
</p>
<p>
(<i>The curtains part at the stair-head, and Lulu, supported
by Schigolch, and in a black dress, slowly and
wearily descends.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Hui, old mold! We've still to get over
the frontier to-day.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Glaring stupidly at Lulu.</i>) Thunder of
heaven! Death!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Speaks, to the end of the act, in the gayest
tones.</i>) Slowly! You're pinching my arm!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> How did you ever get the shamelessness to
break out of prison with such a wolf's face?!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Stop your snout!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I'll run for the police! I'll give information!
This scarecrow let herself be seen in tights?! The
padding alone would cost two months' salary!&mdash;You're
the most perfidious swindler that ever had lodging in
Ox-butter Hotel!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Kindly refrain from insulting the lady!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Insulting you call that?! For this gnawed
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
bone's sake I've worn myself away! I can't earn my
own living! I'll be a clown if I can still stand firm under
a broom-stick! But let the lightning strike me on the
spot if I don't worm ten thousand marks a year for life
out of your tricks and frauds! I can tell you that! A
pleasant trip! I'm going for the police! (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Run, run!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> He'll take good care of himself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> We're rid of <span class="gesperrt">him</span>!&mdash;And now some black
coffee for the lady!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>At the table left.</i>) Here is coffee, ready to
pour.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I must look after the sleeping-car tickets.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Brightly.</i>) Oh, freedom! Thank God for
freedom!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I'll be back for you in half an hour.
We'll celebrate our departure in the station-restaurant.
I'll order a supper that'll keep us going till to-morrow.&mdash;Good
morning, doctor.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Good evening.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Pleasant rest!&mdash;Thanks, I know every
door-handle here. So long! Have a good time!
(<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I haven't seen a room for a year and a half.
Curtains, chairs, pictures....
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Won't you drink it?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I've swallowed enough black coffee these five
days. Have you any brandy?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I've got some elixir de Spaa.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> That reminds one of old times. (<i>Looks
round the hall while Alva fills two glasses.</i>) Where's
my picture gone?
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I've got it in my room, so no one shall see it
here.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Bring it down here now.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Didn't you even lose your vanity in prison?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> How anxious at heart one gets when one
hasn't seen herself for months! One day I got a brand-new
dust-pan. When I swept up at seven in the morning
I held the back of it up before my face. Tin doesn't
flatter, but I took pleasure in it all the same.&mdash;Bring the
picture down from your room. Shall I come too?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> No, Heaven's sake! You must spare yourself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I've been sparing myself long enough now!
(<i>Alva goes out, right, to get the picture.</i>) He has heart-trouble;
but to have to plague one's self with imagination
fourteen months!... He kisses with the fear of death
on him, and his two knees shake like a frozen vagabond's.
In God's name.... In this room&mdash;if only I had not
shot his father in the back!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Returns with the picture of Lulu in the
Pierrot-dress.</i>) It's covered with dust. I had leant it
against the fire-place, face to the wall.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You didn't look at it all the time I was away?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I had so much business to attend to, with the
sale of our paper and everything. Countess Geschwitz
would have liked to have hung it up in her house, but
she had to be prepared for search-warrants. (<i>He puts
the picture on the easel.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Merrily.</i>) Now the poor monster is learning
the joys of life in Hotel Ox-butter by her own experience.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Even now I don't understand how events hang
together.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Oh, Geschwitz arranged it all very cleverly.
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
I must admire her inventiveness. But the cholera must
have raged fearfully in Hamburg this summer; and on
that she founded her plan for freeing me. She took a
course in hospital nursing here, and when she had the
necessary documents she journeyed to Hamburg with
them and nursed the cholera patients. At the first opportunity
that offered she put on the underclothes in
which a sick woman had just died and which really ought
to have been burnt. The same morning she traveled back
here and came to see me in prison. In my cell, while the
wardress was outside, we, as quick as we could, exchanged
underclothes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> So that was the reason why the Countess and
you fell sick of the cholera the same day!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Exactly, that was it! Geschwitz of course
was instantly brought from her house to the contagious
ward in the hospital. But with me, too, they couldn't
think of any other place to take me. So there we lay
in one room in the contagious ward behind the hospital,
and from the first day Geschwitz put forth all her art to
make our two faces as like each other as possible. Day
before yesterday she was let out as cured. Just now
she came back and said she'd forgotten her watch. I put
on her clothes, she slipped into my prison frock, and then
I came away. (<i>With pleasure.</i>) Now she's lying over
there as the murderess of Dr. Sch&ouml;n.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> So far as outward appearance goes you can
still agree with the picture as much as ever.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I'm a little peaked in the face, but otherwise
I've lost nothing. Only one gets incredibly nervous in
prison.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You looked horribly sick when you came in.
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I had to, to get our necks out of the noose.&mdash;And
you? What have you done in this year and a half?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I've had a succ&egrave;s d'estime in literary circles
with a play I wrote about you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Who's your sweetheart now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> An actress I've rented a house for in Karl
Street.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Does she love you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> How should I know that? I haven't seen the
woman for six weeks.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Can you stand that?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You will never understand that. With me
there's the closest alternation between my sensuality and
mental creativeness. So towards you, for example, I have
only the choice of regarding you artistically or of loving
you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>In a fairy-story tone.</i>) I used to dream
every other night that I'd fallen into the hands of a
sadic.... Come, give me a kiss!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> It's shining in your eyes like the water in a
deep well one has just thrown a stone into.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Come!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Kisses her.</i>) Your lips have got pretty thin,
anyway.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Come! (<i>Pushes him into a chair and seats
herself on his knee.</i>) Do you shudder at me?&mdash;In Hotel
Ox-butter we all got a luke-warm bath every four weeks.
The wardresses took that opportunity to search our
pockets as soon as we were in the water. (<i>She kisses him
passionately.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Oh, oh!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You're afraid that when I'm away you couldn't
write any more poems about me?
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> On the contrary, I shall write a dithyramb
upon thy glory.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I'm only sore about the hideous shoes I'm
wearing.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> They do not encroach upon your charms. Let
us be thankful for the favor of this moment.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I don't feel at all like that to-day.&mdash;Do you
remember the costume ball where I was dressed like a
knight's squire? How those wine-full women ran after
me that time? Geschwitz crawled round, round my feet,
and begged me to step on her face with my cloth shoes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Come, dear heart!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>In the tone with which one quiets a restless
child.</i>) Quietly! I shot your father.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I do not love thee less for that. One kiss!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Bend your head back. (<i>She kisses him with
deliberation.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You hold back the fire of my soul with the
most dexterous art. And your breast breathes so virginly
too. Yet if it weren't for your two great, dark, childish
eyes, I must needs have thought you the cunningest
whore that ever hurled a man to destruction.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>In high spirits.</i>) Would God I were!
Come over the border with us to-day! Then we can
see each other as often as we will, and we'll get more
pleasure from each other than now.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Through this dress I feel your body like a
symphony. These slender ankles, this cantabile. This
rapturous crescendo. And these knees, this capriccio.
And the powerful andante of lust!&mdash;How peacefully these
two slim rivals press against each other in the consciousness
that neither equals the other in beauty&mdash;till their capricious

that your senses shall whirl!

<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Merrily.</i>) Meanwhile I'll bury my hands
in your hair. (<i>She does so.</i>) But here we'll be disturbed.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You have robbed me of my reason!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Aren't you coming with me to-day?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> But the old fellow's going with you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> He won't turn up again.&mdash;Is not that the
divan on which your father bled to death?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Be still. Be still....

ACT II
</h2>
<p>
<i>A spacious salon in white stucco. In the rear-wall,
between two high mirrors, a wide folding doorway showing
in the rear room a big card-table surrounded by
Turkish upholstered chairs. In the left wall two doors,
the upper one to the entrance-hall, the lower to the dining-room.
Between them a rococo-console with a white
marble top, and above it Lulu's Pierrot-picture in a narrow
gold frame let into the wall. Two other doors,
right; near the lower one a small table. Wide and
brightly-covered chairs stand about, with thin legs and
fragile arms; and in the middle is a sofa of the same style
(Louis XV.).</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>A large company is moving about the salon in lively
conversation. The men&mdash;<span class="gesperrt">Alva</span>, <span class="gesperrt">Rodrigo</span>, Marquis
<span class="gesperrt">Casti-Piani</span>, Banker <span class="gesperrt">Puntschu</span>, and Journalist
<span class="gesperrt">Heilmann</span>&mdash;are in evening dress. <span class="gesperrt">Lulu</span> wears a
white Directoire dress with huge sleeves and white lace
falling freely from belt to feet. Her arms are in white
kid gloves, her hair done high with a little tuft of white
feathers. <span class="gesperrt">Geschwitz</span> is in a bright blue hussar-waist
trimmed with white fur and laced with silver braid, a
tall tight collar with a white bow and stiff cuffs with
huge ivory links. <span class="gesperrt">Magelone</span> is in bright rainbow-colored
shot silk with very wide sleeves, long narrow
waist, and three ruffles of spiral rose-colored ribbons and
violet bouquets. Her hair is parted in the middle and
drawn low over her temples. On her forehead is a
mother-of-pearl ornament, held by a fine chain under her
hair. <span class="gesperrt">Kadidia</span>, her daughter, twelve years old, has</i>
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
<i>bright-green satin gaiters which yet leave visible the tops
of her white silk socks, and a white-lace-covered dress
with bright-green narrow sleeves, pearl-gray gloves, and
free black hair under a big bright-green hat with white
feathers. <span class="gesperrt">Bianetta</span> is in dark-green velvet, the collar
sewn with pearls, and a full skirt, its hem embroidered
with great false topazes set in silver. <span class="gesperrt">Ludmilla</span>
<span class="gesperrt">Steinherz</span> is in a glaring summer frock striped red
and blue.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Rodrigo stands, centre, a full glass in his hand.</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;please
be quiet&mdash;I drink&mdash;permit me to drink&mdash;for this
is the birthday party of our amiable hostess&mdash;(<i>taking
Lulu's arm</i>) of Countess Adelaide d'Oubra&mdash;damned and
done for!&mdash;I drink therefore&mdash;&mdash;and so forth, go to it,
ladies! (<i>All surround Lulu and clink with her. Alva
presses Rodrigo's hand.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I congratulate you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I'm sweating like a roast pig.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Let's see if everything's in order
in the card-room. (<i>Alva and Lulu exeunt, rear. Bianetta
speaks to Rodrigo.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BIANETTA.</span> They were telling me just now you were
the strongest man in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> That I am. May I put my strength at
your disposal?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> I love sharp-shooters better. Three
months ago a sharp-shooter stepped into the casino and
every time he went &ldquo;bang!&rdquo; I felt like this. (<i>She wriggles
her hips.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> (<i>Who speaks thruout the act in a bored
and weary tone, to Magelone.</i>) Say, dearie, how does it
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
happen we see your nice little princess here for the first
time to-night? (<i>Meaning Kadidia.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> Do you really find her so delightful?&mdash;She
is still in the convent. She must be back in school
again on Monday.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> What did you say, mama?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> I was just telling the gentleman that you
got the highest mark in geometry last week.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> Some pretty hair she's got!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Just look at her feet: the way she
walks!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> By god, she's got breeding!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> (<i>Smiling.</i>) But my dear sirs, take pity
on her! She's nothing but a child still!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> That'd trouble me damned little! (<i>To
Heilmann.</i>) I'd give ten years of my life if I could
initiate the young lady into the ceremonies of our secret
society!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> But you won't get me to consent to that
for a million. I won't have the child's youth ruined, the
way mine was!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Confessions of a lovely soul! (<i>To
Magelone.</i>) Would you not agree, either, for a set of
real diamonds?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> Don't brag! You'll give as few real
diamonds to me as to my child. You know that quite
the best yourself. (<i>Kadidia goes into the rear room.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> But is nobody at all going to play, this
evening?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Why, of course, comtesse. I'm counting
on it very much, for one!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BIANETTA.</span> Then let's take our places right away.
The gentlemen will soon come then.
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> May I ask you to excuse me just a
second. I must say a word to my friend.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> (<i>Offering his arm to Bianetta.</i>) May
I have the honor to be your partner? You always hold
such a lucky hand!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Now just give me your other arm and
then lead us into the gambling-hell. (<i>The three go
off so, rear.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> Say, Mr. Puntschu, have you still got a
few Jungfrau shares for me, maybe?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Jungfrau-shares? (<i>To Heilmann.</i>) The
lady means the stock of the funicular railway on the
Jungfrau. The Jungfrau, you know,&mdash;the Virgin&mdash;is a
mountain up which they want to build a wire railway.
(<i>To Magelone.</i>) You know, just so there may be no
confusion;&mdash;and how easy that would be in this select
circle!&mdash;Yes, I still have some four thousand Jungfrau-shares,
but I should like to keep those for myself. There
won't be such another chance soon of making a little
fortune out of hand.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> I've only one lone share of this Jungfrau-stock
so far. I should like to have more, too.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> I'll try, Mr. Heilmann, to look after
some for you. But I'll tell you beforehand you'll have to
pay drug-store prices for them!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> My fortune-teller advised me to look
about me in time. All my savings are in Jungfrau-shares
now. If it doesn't turn out well, Mr. Puntschu, I'll
scratch your eyes out!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> I am perfectly sure of my affairs, my
dearie!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Who has come back from the card-room, to
Magelone.</i>) I can guarantee your fears are absolutely
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
unfounded. I paid very dear for my Jungfrau-stock and
haven't regretted it a minute. They're going up steadily
from day to day. There never was such a thing before.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> All the better, if you're right. (<i>Taking
Puntschu's arm.</i>) Come, my friend, let's try our luck
now at baccarat. (<i>All go out, rear, except Geschwitz and
Rodrigo who scribbles something on a piece of paper and
folds it up, then notices Geschwitz.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Hm, madam countess&mdash;(<i>Geschwitz starts
and shrinks.</i>) Do I look as dangerous as that? (<i>To
himself.</i>) I must make a bon mot. (<i>Aloud.</i>) May I
perhaps make so bold&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> You can go to the devil!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> (<i>As he leads Lulu in.</i>) Permit me a
word or two.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Not noticing Rodrigo who presses his note
into her hand.</i>) Oh, as many as you like. (<i>Rodrigo
bows and goes out, rear.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> (<i>To Geschwitz.</i>) Leave us alone!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>To Casti-Piani.</i>) Have I hurt you again in
any way?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> (<i>Since Geschwitz does not stir.</i>) Are
you deaf? (<i>Geschwitz, sighing deeply, goes out, rear.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Just say straight out how much you want.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> With money you can no longer serve
me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> What makes you think that we have no more
money?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> You handed out the last bit of it to me
yesterday.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> If you're sure of that then I suppose it's so.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> You're down on the bare ground, you
and your writer.
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Then why all the words?&mdash;If you want to
have me for yourself you need not first threaten me with
execution.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> I know that. But I've told you more
than once that you won't be my downfall. I haven't
sucked you dry because you loved me, but loved you in
order to suck you. Bianetta is more to my taste from
top to bottom than you. You set out the choicest sweetmeats,
and after one has frittered his time away at them
he finds he's hungrier than before. You've loved too
long, even for our present relations. With a healthy
young man, you only ruin his nervous system. But you'll
fit all the more perfectly in the position I have sought
out for you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You're crazy! Have I commissioned you to
find a position for me?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> I told you, though, that I was an appointments-agent.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You told me you were a police spy.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> One can't live on that alone. I was an
appointments-agent originally, till I blundered over a
minister's daughter I'd got a position for in Valparaiso.
The little darling in her childhood's dreams imagined the
life even more intoxicating than it is, and complained of
it to Mama. On that, they nabbed me; but by reliable
demeanor I soon enough won the confidence of the criminal
police and they sent me here on a hundred and fifty
marks a month, because they were tripling our contingent
here on account of these everlasting bomb-explosions. But
who can get along on a hundred and fifty marks a month?
My colleagues get women to support them; but, of course,
I found it more convenient to take up my former calling
again; and of the numberless adventuresses of the best
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
families of the entire world, whom chance brings together
here, I have already forwarded many a young creature
hungry for life to the place of her natural vocation.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Decisively.</i>) I wouldn't do in that business.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Your views on that question make no
difference whatever to me. The department of justice
will pay anyone who delivers the murderess of Dr. Sch&ouml;n
into the hands of the police a thousand marks. I only
need to whistle for the constable who's standing down at
the corner to have earned a thousand marks. Against
that, the House of Oikonomopulos in Cairo bids sixty
pounds for you&mdash;twelve hundred marks&mdash;two hundred
more than the Attorney General. And, besides, I am
still so far a friend of mankind that I prefer to help my
loves to happiness, not plunge them into misfortune.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>As before.</i>) The life in such a house can
never make a woman of my stamp happy. When I was
fifteen, that might have happened to me. I was desperate
then&mdash;thought I should never be happy. I bought a revolver,
and ran one night bare-foot thru the deep snow
over the bridge to the park to shoot myself there.
But then by good luck I lay three months in the hospital
without setting eyes on a man, and in that time my eyes
opened and I got to know myself. Night after night
in my dreams I saw the man for whom I was created and
who was created for me, and then when I was let out on
the men again I was no longer a silly goose. Since then
I can see on a man, in a pitch-dark night and a hundred
feet away, whether we're suited to each other; and if I
sin against that insight I feel the next day dirtied, body
and soul, and need weeks to get over the loathing I have
for myself. And now you imagine I'll give myself to
every and any Tom and Harry!
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Toms and Harries don't patronize Oikonomopulos
of Cairo. His custom consists of Scottish
lords, Russian dignitaries, Indian governors, and our
jolly Rhineland captains of industry. I must only guarantee
that you speak French. With your gift for languages
you'll quickly enough learn as much English, besides,
as you'll need to get on with. And you'll reside in
a royally furnished apartment with an outlook on the
minarets of the El Azhar Mosque, and walk around all
day on Persian carpets as thick as your fist, and dress
every evening in a fabulous Paris gown and drink as much
champagne as your customers can pay for, and, finally,
you'll even remain, up to a certain point, your own mistress.
If the man doesn't please you, you needn't bring
him any reciprocal feelings. Just let him give in his card,
and then&mdash;(<i>Shrugs, and snaps his fingers.</i>) If the ladies
didn't get used to that the whole business would be
simply impossible, because every one after the first four
weeks would go headlong to the devil.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Her voice shaking.</i>) I do believe that since
yesterday you've got a screw loose somewhere. Am I to
understand that the Egyptian will pay fifteen hundred
francs for a person whom he's never seen?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> I took the liberty of sending him your
pictures.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Those pictures that I gave you, you've sent
to him?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> You see he can value them better than
I. The picture in which you stand before the mirror
as Eve he'll probably hang up at the house-door, after
you've got there.... And then there's one thing more
for you to notice: with Oikonomopulos in Cairo you'll
be safer from your blood-hounds than if you crept into
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
a Canadian wilderness. It isn't so easy to transport an
Egyptian courtesan to a German prison,&mdash;first, on account
of the mere expense, and second, from fear of coming too
close to eternal Justice.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Proudly, in a clear voice.</i>) What's your eternal
Justice to do with me! You can see as plain as your
five fingers I shan't let myself be locked up in any such
amusement-place!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Then do you want me to whistle for
the policeman?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>In wonder.</i>) Why don't you simply ask me
for twelve hundred marks, if you want the money?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> I want for no money! And I also don't
ask for it because you're dead broke.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> We still have thirty thousand marks.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> In Jungfrau-stock! I never have anything
to do with stock. The Attorney-General pays in
the national currency, and Oikonomopulos pays in English
gold. You can be on board early to-morrow. The
passage doesn't last much more than five days. In two
weeks at most you're in safety. Here you are nearer to
prison than anywhere. It's a wonder which I, as one of
the secret police, cannot understand, that you two have
been able to live for a full year unmolested. But just
as I came on the track of your antecedents, so any day,
with your mighty consumption of men, one of my colleagues
may make the happy discovery. Then I may just
wipe my mouth, and you spend in prison the most enjoyable
years of your life. If you will kindly decide
quickly. The train goes at 12.30. If we haven't struck
a bargain before eleven, I whistle up the policeman. If
we have, I pack you, just as you stand, into a carriage,
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
drive you to the station, and to-morrow escort you on
board ship.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> But is it possible you can be serious in all this?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Don't you understand that I can act now
only for your bodily rescue?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I'll go with you to America or to China, but I
can't let myself be sold of my own accord! That is worse
than prison!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> (<i>Drawing a letter from his pocket.</i>)
Just read this effusion! I'll read it to you. Here's the
postmark &ldquo;Cairo,&rdquo; so you won't believe I work with
forged documents. The girl is a Berliner, was married
two years and to a man whom you would have envied
her, a former comrade of mine. He travels now for the
Hamburg Colonial Company....
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Merrily.</i>) Then perhaps he <span class="gesperrt">visits</span> his
wife occasionally?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> That is not incredible. But hear this
impulsive expression of her feelings. My white-slave traffic
seems to me absolutely no more honorable than the very
best judge would tax it with being, but a cry of joy like
this lets me feel a certain moral satisfaction for a moment.
I am proud to earn my money by scattering happiness with
full hands. (<i>Reads.</i>) &ldquo;Dear Mr. Meyer&rdquo;&mdash;that's my
name as a white-slave trader&mdash;&ldquo;when you go to Berlin,
please go right away to the conservatory on the Potsdamer
Strasse and ask for Gusti von Rosenkron&mdash;the most beautiful
woman that I've ever seen in nature&mdash;delightful
hands and feet, naturally small waist, straight back, full
body, big eyes and short nose&mdash;just the sort you like best.
I have written to her already. She has no prospects with
her singing. Her mother hasn't a penny. Sorry she's
already twenty-two, but she's pining for love. Can't
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;39]</span>
marry, because absolutely without means. I have spoken
with Madame. They'd like to take another German, if
she's well educated and musical. Italians and Frenchwomen
can't compete with us, 'cause of too little culture.
If you should see Fritz&rdquo;&mdash;Fritz is the husband; he's getting a
divorce, of course,&mdash;&ldquo;tell him it was all a bore.
He didn't know any better, nor did I either.&rdquo; Now come
the exact details&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Goaded.</i>) I can not sell the only thing that
ever was my own!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Let me read some more.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>As before.</i>) This very evening, I'll hand
over to you our entire wealth.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Believe me, for God's sake, I've <span class="gesperrt">got</span>
your last red cent! If we haven't left this house before
eleven, you and your lot will be transported to-morrow
in a police-car to Germany.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You <span class="gesperrt">can't</span> give me up!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Do you think that would be the worst
thing I can have done in my life?... I must, in case
we go to-night, have just a brief word with Bianetta.
(<i>He goes into the card-room, leaving the door open behind
him. Lulu stares before her, mechanically crumpling
up the note that Rodrigo stuck into her hand, which she
has held in her fingers thruout the dialog. Alva, behind
the card-table, gets up, a bill in his hand, and comes into
the salon.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Brilliantly! It's going brilliantly!
Geschwitz is wagering her last shirt. Puntschu
has promised me ten more Jungfrau-shares. Steinherz is
making her little gains and profits. (<i>Exit, lower right.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I in a bordell?&mdash;(<i>She reads the paper she holds,
and laughs madly.</i>)
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;40]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Coming back with a cash-box in his hand.</i>)
Aren't you going to play, too?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Oh, yes, surely&mdash;why not?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> By the way, it's in the Berliner Tageblatt to-day
that Alfred Hugenberg has hurled himself over the
stairs in prison.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Is he too in prison?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Only in a sort of house of detention. (<i>Exit,
rear. Lulu is about to follow, but Countess Geschwitz
meets her in the door-way.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> You are going because I come?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Resolutely.</i>) No, God knows. But when
you come then I go.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> You have defrauded me of all the good
things of this world that I still possessed. You might
at the very least preserve the outward forms of politeness
in your intercourse with me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>As before.</i>) I am as polite to you as to any
other woman. I only beg you to be equally so to me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Have you forgotten the passionate endearments
by which, while we lay together in the hospital,
you seduced me into letting myself be locked
into prison for you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Well, why else did you bring me down with
the cholera beforehand? I swore very different things
to myself, even while it was going on, from what I had
to promise you! I am shaken with horror at the thought
that that should ever become reality!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Then you cheated me consciously, deliberately?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Gaily.</i>) What have you been cheated of,
then? Your physical advantages have found so enthusiastic
an admirer here, that I ask myself if I won't have
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
to give piano lessons once more, to keep alive! No
seventeen-year-old child could make a man madder with
love than you, a pervert, are making him, poor fellow,
by your shrewishness.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Of whom are you speaking? I don't
understand a word.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>As before.</i>) I'm speaking of your acrobat,
of Rodrigo Quast. He's an athlete: he balances two
saddled cavalry horses on his chest. Can a woman desire
anything more glorious? He told me just now that he'd
jump into the water to-night if you did not take pity
on him.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> I do not envy you this cleverness with
which you torture the helpless victims sacrificed to you
by their inscrutable destiny. My own plight has not yet
wrung from me the pity that I feel for you. <i>I</i> feel free
as a god when I think to what creatures <span class="gesperrt">you</span> are enslaved.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Who do you mean?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Casti-Piani, upon whose forehead the
most degenerate baseness is written in letters of fire!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Be silent! I'll kick you, if you speak ill of
<span class="gesperrt">him</span>. He loves me with an uprightness against which
your most venturous self-sacrifices are poor as beggary!
He gives me such proofs of self-denial as reveal <span class="gesperrt">you</span>
for the first time in all your loathsomeness! You didn't
get finished in your mother's womb, neither as woman
nor as man. You have no human nature like the rest
of us. The stuff didn't go far enough for a man, and
for a woman you got too much brain into your skull.
That's the reason you're crazy! Turn to Miss Bianetta!
She can be had for everything for pay! Press a gold-piece
into her hand and she'll belong to you. (<i>All the</i>
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
<i>company save Kadidia throng in out of the card-room.</i>)
For the Lord's sake, what has happened?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Nothing whatever! We're thirsty, that's
all.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> Everybody has won. We can't believe it.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BIANETTA.</span> It seems I have won a whole fortune!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Don't boast of it, my child. That isn't
lucky.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> But the bank has won, too! How is
that <span class="gesperrt">possible</span>?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> It is colossal, where all the money comes from!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Let us not ask! Enough that we need
not spare the champagne.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> I can pay for a supper in a respectable
restaurant afterwards, anyway!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> To the buffet, ladies! Come to the buffet!
(<i>All exeunt, lower left.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Holding Lulu back.</i>) Un momong, my
heart. Have you read my billet-doux?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Threaten me with discovery as much as you
like! I have no more twenty thousands to dispose of.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Don't lie to me, you punk! You've still
got forty thousand in Jungfrau-stock. Your so-called
spouse has just been bragging of it himself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Then turn to <span class="gesperrt">him</span> with your blackmailing!
It's all one to me what he does with his money.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Thank you! With that blockhead I'd need
twice twenty-four hours to make him grasp what I was
talking about. And then come his explanations, that
make one deathly sick; and meanwhile my bride writes
me &ldquo;It's all up!&rdquo; and I can just hang a hurdy-gurdy over
my shoulder.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Have you got engaged here, then?
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Maybe I ought to have asked your permission
first? What were my thanks here that I freed
you from prison at the cost of my health? You abandoned
me! I might have had to be a baggage-man if this
girl hadn't taken me up! At my very first entrance, right
away, they threw a velvet-covered arm-chair at my head!
This country is too decadent to value genuine shows of
strength any more. If I'd been a boxing kangaroo they'd
have interviewed me and put my picture in all the papers.
Thank heaven, I'd already made the acquaintance of my
Celestine. She's got the savings of twenty years deposited
with the government; and she loves me just for myself.
She doesn't aim only at vulgar things, like you. She's
had three children by an American bishop&mdash;all of the
greatest promise. Day after to-morrow we'll get married
by the registrar.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You have my blessing.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Your blessing <span class="gesperrt">can</span> be stolen from me. I've
told my bride I had twenty thousand in stock at the bank.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Amused.</i>) And after that he boasts the person
loves him for himself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> She honors in me the man of mind, not the
man of might as you and all the others have done. That's
over now. First they tore the clothes from one's body
and then they waltzed around with the chambermaid.
I'll be a skeleton before I'll let myself in again for such
diversions!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Then why the devil do you pursue the unfortunate
Geschwitz with your attentions?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Because the creature is of noble blood. I'm
a man of the world, and can do distinguished conversation
better than any of you. But now (<i>with a gesture</i>)
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
my talk is hanging out of my mouth! Will you get me
the money before to-morrow evening or won't you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I have no money.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I'll have hen-droppings in my head before
I'll let myself be put off with that! He'll give you his
last cent if you'll only do your damned duty once! You
lured the poor lad here, and now he can see where to
scare up a suitable engagement for his accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> What has it to do with you if he wastes his
money with women or at cards?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Do you absolutely <span class="gesperrt">want</span>, then, to throw
the last penny that his father earned by his paper into
the jaws of this rapacious pack? You'll make four people
happy if you'll not take things too exactly and sacrifice
yourself for a beneficent purpose! Has it got to be
only Casti-Piani <span class="gesperrt">forever</span>?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Lightly.</i>) Shall I ask him perhaps to light
you down the stairs?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> As you wish, countess! If I don't get the
twenty thousand marks by to-morrow evening, I make a
statement to the police and your court has an end. Auf
Wiedersehen! (<i>Heilmann enters, breathless, upper right.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You're looking for Miss Magelone? She's not
here.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> No, I'm looking for something else&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Taking him to the entry-door, opposite
him.</i>) Second door on the left.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>To Rodrigo.</i>) Did you learn that from your
bride?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> (<i>Bumping into Puntschu in the doorway.</i>)
Excuse me, my angel!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Ah, it's you. Miss Magelone's waiting
for you in the lift.
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> You go up with her, please. I'll be
right back. (<i>He hurries out, left. Lulu goes out at lower
left. Rodrigo follows her.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Some heat, that! If I don't cut off <span class="gesperrt">your</span>
ears, you'll cut 'em off me! If I can't hire out my Jehoshaphat,
I've just got to help myself with my brains!
Won't they get wrinkled, my brains! Won't they get
indisposed! Won't they need to bathe in Eau de Cologne!
(<i>Bob, a groom in a red jacket, tight leather
breeches, and twinkling riding-boots, 15 years old, brings
in a telegram.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BOB.</span> Mr. Puntschu, the banker!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> (<i>Breaks open the telegram and murmurs:</i>)
&ldquo;Jungfrau Funicular Stock fallen to&mdash;&rdquo; Ay, ay,
so goes the world! (<i>To Bob.</i>) Wait! (<i>Gives him a
tip.</i>) Tell me&mdash;what's your name?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BOB.</span> Well, it's really Freddy, but they call me Bob,
because that's the fashion now.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> How old are you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BOB.</span> Fifteen.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> (<i>Enters hesitatingly from lower left.</i>) I
beg your pardon, can you tell me if mama is here?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> No, my dear. (<i>Aside.</i>) Devil, she's
got breeding!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> I'm hunting all over for her; I can't find
her anywhere.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Your mama will turn up again soon, as
true as my name's Puntschu! (<i>Looking at Bob.</i>) And
that pair of breeches! God of Justice! It gets uncanny!
(<i>He goes out, upper right.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> Haven't <span class="gesperrt">you</span> seen my mama, perhaps?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BOB.</span> No, but you only need to come with me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> Where is she then?
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BOB.</span> She's gone up in the lift. Come along.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> No, no, I can't go up with you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BOB.</span> We can hide up there in the corridor.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> No, no, I can't come, or I'll be scolded.
(<i>Magelone, terribly excited, rushes in, upper left, and
possesses herself of Kadidia.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> Ha, there you are at last, you common
creature!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> (<i>Crying.</i>) O mama, mama, I was hunting
for you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> Hunting for me? Did I tell you to hunt
for me? What have you had to do with this fellow?
(<i>Heilmann, Alva, Ludmilla, Puntschu, Geschwitz, and
Lulu enter, lower left. Bob has withdrawn.</i>) Now
don't bawl before all the people on me; look out, I
tell you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>As they all surround Kadidia.</i>) But you're
crying, sweetheart! Why are you crying?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> By God, she's really been crying! Who's
done anything to hurt you, little goddess?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> (<i>Kneels before her and folds her in her
arms.</i>) Tell me, cherub, what bad thing has happened.
Do you want a cookie? Do you want some chocolate?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> It's just nerves. The child's getting them
much too soon. It would be the best thing if no one
paid any attention to her!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> That sounds like you! You're a pretty
mother! The courts'll yet take the child away from you
and appoint me her guardian! (<i>Stroking Kadidia's
cheeks.</i>) Isn't that so, my little goddess?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> I should be glad if we started the baccarat
again at last? (<i>All go into the card-room. Lulu
is held back at the door by Bob.</i>)
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>When Bob has whispered to her.</i>) Certainly!
Let him come in! (<i>Bob opens the door and lets Schigolch
enter, in evening dress, his patent-leather shoes
much worn, and keeping on his shabby opera hat.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>With a look at Bob.</i>) Where d'd you
get him from?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> The circus.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> How much does he get?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Ask him if it interests you. (<i>To Bob.</i>) Shut
the doors. (<i>Bob goes out lower left, shutting the door
behind him.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Sitting down.</i>) The truth is, I'm in
need of money. I've hired a flat for my mistress.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Have you taken another mistress here, too?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She's from Frankfort. In her youth she
was mistress to the King of Naples. She tells me every
day she was once very bewitching.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Outwardly with complete composure.</i>) Does
she need the money very badly?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She wants to fit up her own apartments.
Such sums are of no account to <span class="gesperrt">you</span>. (<i>Lulu is suddenly
overcome with a fit of weeping.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Flinging herself at Schigolch.</i>) O God Omnipotent!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Patting her.</i>) Well? What is it now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Sobbing violently.</i>) It's too horrible!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Draws her onto his knee and holds her
in his arms like a little child.</i>) Hm&mdash;You're trying to
do too much, child. You must go to bed, now and then,
with a story.&mdash;Cry, that's right, cry it all out. It used
to shake you just so fifteen years ago. Nobody has
screamed since then, the way you could scream! You
didn't wear any white tufts on your head then, nor any
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
transparent stockings on your legs: you had neither shoes
nor stockings then.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Crying.</i>) Take me home with you! Take
me home with you to-night! Please! We'll find carriages
enough downstairs!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I'll take you with me; I'll take you with
me.&mdash;What is it?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> It's going round my neck! I'm to be shown up!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> By who? Who's showing you up?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> The acrobat.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>With the utmost composure.</i>) I'll look
after him.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Look after him! <span class="gesperrt">Please</span>, look after him!
Then do with me what you will!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> If he comes to me, he's done for. My
window is over the water. But (<i>shaking his head</i>) he
won't come; he won't come.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> What number do you live at?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> 376, the last house before the hippodrome.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I'll send him there. He'll come with the crazy
person that creeps about my feet. He'll come this very
evening. Go home and let them find it comfortable.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Just let them come.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> To-morrow bring the gold rings he wears in
his ears.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Has he got rings in his ears?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You can take them out before you let him
down. He doesn't notice anything when he's drunk.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> And then, child&mdash;what then?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Then I'll give you the money for your mistress.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I call that pretty stingy.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> And whatever else you want! What I have!
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> It's pretty near ten years since we knew
each other.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Is that all?&mdash;But you've got a mistress.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> My Frankforter is no longer of to-day.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> But then swear!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Haven't I always kept my word to you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Swear that you'll look after him!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I'll look after him.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Swear it to me! Swear it to me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Puts his hand on her ankle.</i>) By everything
that's holy! To-night, if he comes&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> By everything that's holy!&mdash;How cool that is!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> How hot this is!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Drive straight home. They'll come in half-an-hour!
Take a carriage!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I'm going.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Quick! Please!&mdash; &mdash;All-powerful&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Why do you stare at me so again already?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Nothing&mdash;....
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Well? Is your tongue frozen on you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> My garter's broken.
</p>
<p>
SCHIGOLCH. What if it is? Is that all?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> What does that augur?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What does it? I'll fasten it for you if
you'll keep still.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> That augurs misfortune!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Yawning.</i>) Not for you, child. Cheer
up, I'll look after him! (<i>Exit. Lulu puts her left foot
on a foot-stool, fastens her garter, and goes out into the
card-room. Then Rodrigo is cuffed in from the dining-room,
lower left, by Casti-Piani.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> You can treat me decently anyway!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> (<i>Still perfectly unemotional.</i>) Whatever
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
would induce me to do that? I will know what you
said to her here a little while ago.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Then you can be very fond of me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Will you bandy words with me, dog?
You demanded that she go up in the lift with you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> That's a shameless, perfidious lie!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> She told me so herself. You threatened
to denounce her if she didn't go with you.&mdash;Shall I shoot
you on the spot?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> The shameless hussy! As if anything like
that could occur to me!&mdash;Even if I should want to have
her, God knows I don't first need to threaten her with
prison!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">CASTI-PIANI.</span> Thank you. That's all I wanted to
know. (<i>Exit, upper left.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Such a hound! A fellow I could throw up
onto the roof so he'd stick like a Limburger cheese!&mdash;Come
back here, so I can wind your guts round your
neck. That would be even better!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Enters, lower left; merrily.</i>) Where were
you? I've been hunting for you like a pin.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> I've shown <span class="gesperrt">him</span> what it means to start
anything with me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Whom?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Your Casti-Piani! What made you tell him,
you slut, that I wanted to seduce you?!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Did you not ask me to give myself to my deceased
husband's son for twenty thousand in Jungfrau
shares?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Because it's your duty to take pity on the
poor young fellow! You shot away his father before his
nose in the very best years of life! But your Casti-Piani
will think it over before he comes into my sight again.
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
I gave him one in the basket that made the tripes fly to
heaven like Roman candles. If you've got no better substitute
for me, then I'm sorry ever to have had your favor!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Lady Geschwitz is in the fearfullest case. She
twists herself up in fits. She's at the point of jumping
into the water if you let her wait any longer.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> What's the beast waiting for?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> For you, to take her with you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Then give her my regards, and she can jump
into the water.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> She'll lend me twenty thousand marks to save
me from destruction if you will preserve her from it herself.
If you'll take her off to-night, I'll deposit twenty
thousand marks to-morrow in your name at any bank you
say.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> And if I don't take her off with me?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Denounce me! Alva and I are dead broke.
</p>
<p>
RODRIGO. Devil and damnation!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You make four people happy if you don't take
things too exactly and sacrifice yourself for a beneficent
purpose.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> That won't go; I know that, beforehand.
I've tried that out enough now. Who counts on an honorable
soul like that in a bag o' bones! What the person had
for me was her being an aristocrat. My behavior was as
gentleman-like, and more, as you could find among German
circus-people. If I'd only just pinched her in the
calves once!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Watchfully.</i>) She is still a virgin.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Sighing.</i>) If there's a God in heaven,
you'll get paid for your jokes some day! I prophesy that.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Geschwitz waits. What shall I tell her?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> My very best wishes, and I am perverse.
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I will deliver that.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Wait a sec. Is it certain sure I get twenty
thousand marks from her?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Ask herself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> Then tell her I'm ready. I await her in
the dining-room. I must just first look after a barrel of
caviare. (<i>Exit, left. Lulu opens the rear door and calls
in a clear voice &ldquo;Martha!&rdquo; Countess Geschwitz enters,
closing the door behind her.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Pleased.</i>) Dear heart, you can save me from
death to-night.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> How?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> By going to a certain house with the acrobat.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> What for, dear?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> He says you must belong to him this very night
or he'll denounce me to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> You know I can't belong to any man.
My fate has not permitted that.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> If you don't please him, that's his own fix.
Why has he fallen in love with you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> But he'll get as brutal as a hangman.
He'll revenge himself for his disappointment and beat my
head in. I've been thru that already.... Can you not
possibly spare me this hardest test?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> What will you gain by his denouncing me?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> I have still enough of my fortune to take
us to America together in the steerage. There you'd be
safe from all your pursuers.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Pleased and gay.</i>) I want to stay here.
I can never be happy in any other city. You must
tell him that you can't live without him. Then he'll
feel flattered and be gentle as a lamb. You must pay
the coachman, too: give him this paper with the address
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
on it. 376 is a sixth-class hotel where they're expecting
you with him this evening.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Geschwitz.</span> (<i>Shuddering.</i>) How can such a monstrosity
save your life? I don't understand that. You
have conjured up to torture me the most terrible fate that
can fall upon outlawed me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Watchful.</i>) Perhaps the encounter will cure
you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Sighing.</i>) O Lulu, if an eternal retribution
does exist, I hope I may not have to answer then for
you. I cannot make myself believe that no God watches
over us. Yet you are probably right that there is nothing
there, for how can an insignificant worm like me
have provoked his wrath so as to experience only horror
there where all living creation swoons for bliss?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You needn't complain. When you <span class="gesperrt">are</span> happy
you're a hundred thousand times happier than one of us
ordinary mortals ever is!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> I know that too! I envy no one! But I
am still waiting. You have deceived me so often already.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I am yours, my darling, if you quiet Mr. Acrobat
till to-morrow. He only wants his vanity placated.
You must beseech him to take pity on you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> And to-morrow?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I await you, my heart. I shall not open my
eyes till you come: see no chambermaid, receive no hair-dresser,
not open my eyes before you are with me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Then let him come.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> But you must throw yourself at his head, dear!
Have you got the house-number?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Three-seventy-six. But quick now!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Calls into the dining-room.</i>) Ready, my
darling?
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;54]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Entering.</i>) The ladies will pardon my
mouth's being full.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Seizing his hand.</i>) I implore you, have
mercy on my need!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">RODRIGO.</span> A la bonne heure! Let us mount the scaffold!
(<i>Offers her his arm.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Good-night, children! (<i>Accompanies them into
the corridor.... then quickly returns with Bob.</i>)
Quick, quick, Bob! We must get away this moment!
You escort me! But we must change clothes!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BOB.</span> (<i>Curt and clear.</i>) As the gracious lady bids.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Oh what, gracious lady! You give me your
clothes and put on mine. Come! (<i>Exeunt into the dining-room.
Noise in the card-room, the doors are torn
open, and Puntschu, Heilmann, Alva, Bianetta, Magelone,
Kadidia and Ludmilla enter, Heilmann holding a piece of
paper with a glowing Alpine peak at its top.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> (<i>To Puntschu.</i>) Will you accept this
share of Jungfrau-stock, sir?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> But that paper has no exchange, my
friend.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> You rascal! You just don't want to give
me my revenge!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> (<i>To Bianetta.</i>) Have you any idea what
it's all about?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Puntschu has taken all his money from
him, and now gives up the game.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> Now he's got cold feet, the filthy Jew!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> How have I given up the game? How
have I got cold feet? The gentleman has merely to lay
plain cash! Is this my banking-office I'm in? He can
proffer me his trash to-morrow morning!
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;55]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> Trash you call that? The stock in my
knowledge is at 210!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Yesterday it was at 210, you're right.
To-day, it's just nowhere. And to-morrow you'll find
nothing cheaper or more tasteful to paper your stairs with.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> But how is that possible? Then we <span class="gesperrt">would</span>
be down and out!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Well, what am <i>I</i> to say, who have lost
my whole fortune in it! To-morrow morning I shall
have the pleasure of taking up the struggle for an assured
existence for the thirty-sixth time!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> (<i>Passing forward.</i>) Am I dreaming or
do I really hear the Jungfrau-stock has fallen?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Fallen even lower than you! Tho you
can use 'em for curl-paper.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> O God in Heaven! Ten years' work!
(<i>Falls in a faint.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> Wake up, mama! Wake up!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">BIANETTA.</span> Say, Mr. Puntschu, where will you eat
this evening, since you've lost your whole fortune?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">PUNTSCHU.</span> Wherever you like, young lady! Take
me where you will, but quickly! Here it's getting frightful.
(<i>Exeunt Puntschu and Bianetta.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> (<i>Squeezing up his stock and flinging it to
the ground.</i>) That is what one gets from this pack!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Why do you speculate on the Jungfrau
too? Send a few little notices on the company to the
German police here, and then you'll still win something
in the end.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> I've never tried that in my life, but if
you want to help me&mdash;?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Let's go to an all-night restaurant. Do
you know the Five-footed Calf?
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;56]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> I'm very sorry&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Or the Sucking Lamb, or the Smoking
Dog? They're all right near here. We'll be all by ourselves
there, and before dawn we'll have a little article
ready.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">HEILMANN.</span> Don't you sleep?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LUDMILLA.</span> Oh, of course; but not at night. (<i>Exeunt
Heilmann and Ludmilla.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Who has been trying to resuscitate Magelone.</i>)
Ice-cold hands! Ah, what a splendid woman!
We must undo her waist. Come, Kadidia, undo your
mother's waist! She's so fearfully tight-laced.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> (<i>Without stirring.</i>) I'm afraid. (<i>Lulu
enters lower left in a jockey-cap, red jacket, white leather
breeches and riding boots, a riding cape over her
shoulders.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Have you any cash, Alva?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Looking up.</i>) Have you gone crazy?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> In two minutes the police'll be here. We are
denounced. You can stay of course, if you're eager to!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Springing up.</i>) Merciful Heaven! (<i>Exeunt
Alva and Lulu.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> (<i>Shaking her mother, in tears.</i>) Mama,
Mama! Wake up! They've all run away!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> (<i>Coming to herself.</i>) And youth gone!
And my best days gone! Oh, this life!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> But I'm young, mama! Why shouldn't I
earn any money? I don't want to go back to the convent!
Please, mama, keep me with you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> God bless you, sweetheart! You don't
know what you say&mdash;Oh, no, I shall look around for
an engagement in a Variet&eacute;, and sing the people my misfortunes
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
with the Jungfrau-stock. Things like that are
always applauded.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> But you've got no voice, mama!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> Ah, yes, that's true!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KADIDIA.</span> Take me with you to the Variet&eacute;!
</p>

<span class="allsmcap">MAGELONE.</span> No, it would break my heart!&mdash;But, well,

to-morrow!

ACT III
</h2>
<p>
<i>An attic room, without windows, but with two sky-lights,
under one of which stands a bowl filled with rain-water.
Down right, a door thru a board partition into a
sort of cubicle under the slanting roof. Near it, a wobbly
flower-table with a bottle and a smoking oil-lamp on it.
Upper right, a worn-out couch. Door centre; near it, a
chair without a seat. Down left, below the entrance door,
a torn gray mattress. None of the doors can shut tight.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The rain beats on the roof. Schigolch in a long gray
overcoat lies on the mattress; Alva on the couch, wrapped
in a plaid whose straps still hang on the wall above him.</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> The rain's drumming for the parade.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Cheerful weather for her first appearance! I
dreamt just now we were dining together at Olympia.
Bianetta was still with us. The table-cloth was dripping
on all four sides with champagne.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Ya, ya. And I was dreaming of a Christmas
pudding. (<i>Lulu appears, back, barefoot, in a torn
black dress, but with her hair falling to her shoulders.</i>)
Where have you been? Curling your hair first?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> She only does that to revive old memories.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> If one could only get warmed, just a little,
from one of you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Will you enter barefoot on your pilgrimage?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> The first step always costs all kinds of
moaning and groaning. Twenty years ago it was no whit
better, and what she has learned since then! The coals
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
only have to be blown. When she's been at it a week,
not ten locomotives will hold her in our miserable attic.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> The bowl is running over.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> What shall I do with the water?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Pour it out the window. (<i>Lulu gets up on the
chair and empties the bowl thru the sky-light.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> It looks as if the rain would let up at last.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Your wasting the time when the clerks
go home after supper.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Would to God I were lying somewhere where
no step would wake me any more!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Would I were, too! Why prolong this life?
Let's rather starve to death together this very evening in
peace and concord! Is it not the last stage now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Why don't <span class="gesperrt">you</span> go out and get us something
to eat? You've never earned a penny in your whole life!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> In this weather, when no one would kick a
dog from his door?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> But me! I, with the little blood I have left
in my limbs, I am to stop your mouths!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I don't touch a farthing of the money!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Let her go, just! I long for one more
Christmas pudding; then I've had enough.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> And I long for one more beefsteak and a cigarette;
then die! I was just dreaming of a cigarette, such
as has never yet been smoked!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She'll see us put an end to before her
eyes, before doing herself a little pleasure.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> The people on the street will sooner leave cloak
and coat in my hands than go with me for nothing! If
you hadn't sold my clothes, I at least wouldn't need to be
afraid of the lamp-light. I'd like to see the woman who
could earn anything in the rags I'm wearing on my body!
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;60]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I have left nothing human untried. As long
as I had money I spent whole nights making up tables
with which one couldn't help winning against the cleverest
card-sharps. And yet evening after evening I lost more
than if I had shaken out gold by the pailful. Then I
offered my services to the courtesans; but they don't take
anyone without the stamps of the courts, and they see
at the first glance if one's related to the guillotine or
not.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Ya, ya.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I spared myself no disillusionments; but when
I made jokes, they laughed at <span class="gesperrt">me</span>, and when I behaved
as respectable as I am, they boxed my ears, and when I
tried being smutty, they got so chaste and maidenly that
my hair stood up on my head for horror. He who has not
prevailed over society, they have no confidence in.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Won't you kindly put on your boots now,
child? I don't think I shall grow much older in this
lodging. It's months since I had any feeling in the ends
of my toes. Toward midnight, I'll drink a bit more down
in the pub. The lady that keeps it told me yesterday I
seemed to really want to be her lover.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> In the name of the three devils, I'll go down!
(<i>She puts to her mouth the bottle on the flower-table.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> So they can smell your stink a half-hour
off!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I shan't drink it all.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> You won't go down. You're my woman.
You shan't go down. I forbid it!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> What would you forbid your woman when you
can't support yourself?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Whose fault is that? Who but my woman has
laid me on the sick-bed?
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;61]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Am I sick?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Who has trailed me thru the dung? Who has
made me my father's murderer?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Did <span class="gesperrt">you</span> shoot him? He didn't lose much,
but when I see you lying there I could hack off both my
hands for having sinned so against my judgment! (<i>She
goes out, into her room.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> She infected me from her Casti-Piani. It's a
long time since she was susceptible to it herself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Little devils like her can't begin putting
up with it too soon, if angels are ever going to come out
of them.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> She ought to have been born Empress of Russia.
Then she'd have been in the right place. A second Catherine
the Second! (<i>Lulu re-enters with a worn-out pair
of boots, and sits on the floor to put them on.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> If only I don't go headfirst down the stairs!
Ugh, how cold! Is there anything in the world more
dismal than a daughter of joy?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Patience, patience! She's only got to
take the right road into the business at the start.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> It's all right with me! Nothing's wrong with
me any more. (<i>Puts the bottle to her lips.</i>) That
warms one! O accursed! (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> When we hear her coming, we must
creep into my cubby-hole awhile.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I'm damned sorry for her! When I think back....
I grew up with her in a way, you know.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She'll hold out as long as I live, anyway.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> We treated each other at first like brother and
sister. Mama was still living then. I met her by chance
one morning when she was dressing. Dr. Goll had been
called for a consultation. Her hair-dresser had read my
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span>
first poem, that I'd had printed in &ldquo;Society&rdquo;: &ldquo;Follow thy
pack far over the mountains; it will return again, covered
with sweat and dust&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Oh, ya!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> And then she came, in rose-colored muslin, with
nothing under it but a white satin slip&mdash;for the Spanish
ambassador's ball. Dr. Goll seemed to feel his death
near. He asked me to dance with her, so she shouldn't
cause any mad acts. Papa meanwhile never turned his
eyes from us, and all thru the waltz she was looking over
my shoulder, only at him.... Afterwards she shot him.
It is unbelievable.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I've only got a very strong doubt whether
anyone will bite any more.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I shouldn't like to advise it to anybody! (<i>Schigolch
grunts.</i>) At that time, tho she was a fully developed
woman, she had the expression of a five-year-old,
joyous, utterly healthy child. And she was only three
years younger than me then&mdash;but how long ago it is now!
For all her immense superiority in matters of practical
life, she let me explain &ldquo;Tristan and Isolde&rdquo; to
her&mdash;and how entrancingly she could listen! Out
of the little sister who at her marriage still felt like a
school-girl, came the unhappy, hysterical artist's wife.
Out of the artist's wife came then the spouse of my
blessed father, and out of <span class="gesperrt">her</span> came, then, my mistress.
Well, so that is the way of the world. Who will prevail
against it?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> If only she doesn't skid away from the
gentlemen with honorable intentions and bring us up instead
some vagabond she's exchanged her heart's secrets
with.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I kissed her for the first time in her rustling
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>
bridal dress. But afterwards she didn't remember it....
All the same, I believe she had thought of me even in my
father's arms. It can't have been often with him: he had
his best time behind him, and she deceived him with
coachman and boot-black; but when she did give herself to
him, then <i>I</i> stood before her soul. Thru that, too, without
my realizing it, she attained this dreadful power over
me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> There they are! (<i>Heavy steps are heard
mounting the stairs.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Starting up.</i>) I will not endure it! I'll
throw the fellow out!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Wearily picks himself up, takes Alva by
the collar and cuffs him toward the left.</i>) Forward, forward!
How is the young man to confess his trouble to
her with us two sprawling round here?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> But if he demands other things&mdash;low things&mdash;of
her?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> If, well, if! What more will he demand
of her? He's only a man like the rest of us!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> We must leave the door open.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Pushing Alva in, right.</i>) Nonsense!
Lie down!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I'll hear it soon enough. Heaven spare him!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Closing the door, from inside.</i>) Shut up!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Faintly.</i>) He'd better look out! (<i>Lulu enters,
followed by Hunidei, a gigantic figure with a
smooth-shaven, rosy face, sky-blue eyes, and a friendly
smile. He wears a tall hat and overcoat and carries a
dripping umbrella.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Here's where I live. (<i>Hunidei puts his finger
to his lips and looks at Lulu significantly. Then he opens
his umbrella and puts it on the floor, rear, to dry.</i>) Of
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
course, I know it isn't very comfortable here. (<i>Hunidei
comes forward and puts his hand over her mouth.</i>) What
do you mean me to understand by that? (<i>Hunidei puts
his hand over her mouth, and his finger to his lips.</i>) I
don't know what that means. (<i>Hunidei quickly stops her
mouth. Lulu frees herself.</i>) We're quite alone here. No
one will hear us. (<i>Hunidei lays his finger on his lips,
shakes his head, points at Lulu, opens his mouth as if to
speak, points at himself and then at the door.</i>) Herr
Gott, he's a monster! (<i>Hunidei stops her mouth; then
goes rear, folds up his overcoat and lays it over the chair
near the door; then comes down with a broad smile, takes
Lulu's head in both his hands and kisses her on the forehead.
The door, right, half opens.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Behind the door.</i>) He's got a screw
loose.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> He'd better look out!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She couldn't have brought up anything
drearier!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Stepping back.</i>) I hope you're going to give
me something! (<i>Hunidei stops her mouth and presses a
gold-piece in her hand, then looks at her uncertain, questioningly,
as she examines it and throws it from one hand
to the other.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> All right, it's good. (<i>Puts it into her pocket.
Hunidei quickly stops her mouth, gives her a few silver
coins, and glances at her commandingly.</i>) Oh, that's nice
of you! (<i>Hunidei leaps madly about the room, brandishing
his arms and staring upward in despair. Lulu cautiously
nears him, throws an arm round him and kisses
him on the mouth. Laughing soundlessly, he frees himself
from her and looks questioningly. She takes up the lamp
and opens the door to her room. He goes in smiling, taking</i>
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;65]</span>
<i>off his hat. The stage is dark save for what light
comes thru the cracks of the door. Alva and Schigolch
creep out on all fours.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> They're gone.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Behind him.</i>) Wait.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> One can hear nothing here.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> You've heard that often enough!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I will kneel before her door.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Little mother's sonny! (<i>Presses past
Alva, gropes across the stage to Hunidei's coat, and
searches the pockets. Alva crawls to Lulu's door.</i>)
Gloves, nothing more! (<i>Turns the coat round, searches
the inside pockets, pulls a book out that he gives to Alva.</i>)
Just see what that is. (<i>Alva holds the book to the light.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Wearily deciphering the title-page.</i>) Warnings
to pious pilgrims and such as wish to be so. Very
helpful. Price, 2 s. 6 d.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> It looks to me as if God had left <span class="gesperrt">him</span>
pretty completely. (<i>Lays the coat over the chair again
and makes for the cubby-hole.</i>) There's nothing doing
with these people. The country's best time's behind it!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Life is never as bad as it's painted. (<i>He, too,
creeps back.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Not even a silk muffler he's got and yet
in Germany we creep on our bellies before this rabble.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Come, let's vanish again.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She only thinks of herself, and takes the
first man that runs across her path. Hope the dog remembers
her the rest of his life! (<i>They disappear, left,
shutting the door behind them. Lulu re-enters, setting
the lamp on the table. Hunidei follows.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Will you come to see me again? (<i>Hunidei
stops her mouth. She looks upward in a sort of despair</i>
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span>
<i>and shakes her head. Hunidei, putting his coat on, approaches
her grinning; she throws her arms around his
neck; he gently frees himself, kisses her hand, and turns
to the door. She starts to accompany him, but he signs
to her to stay behind and noiselessly leaves the room. Schigolch
and Alva re-enter.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Tonelessly.</i>) How he has stirred me up!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> How much did he give you?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>As before.</i>) Here it is! All! Take it! I'm
going down again.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> We can still live like princes up here.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> He's coming back.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Then let's just retire again, quick.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> He's after his prayer-book. Here it is. It
must have fallen out of his coat.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Listening.</i>) No, that isn't he. That's some
one else.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Some one's coming up. I hear it quite plainly.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Now there's some one tapping at the door.
Who may that be?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Probably a good friend he's recommended
us to. Come in! (<i>Countess Geschwitz enters, in poor
clothes, with a canvas roll in her hand.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) If I've come at a bad
time, I'll turn around again. The truth is, I haven't
spoken to a living soul for ten days. I must just tell you
right off, I haven't got any money. My brother never
answered me at all.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Your ladyship would now like to stretch
her feet out under our table?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Tonelessly.</i>) I'm going down again.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Where are you going in this pomp?&mdash;However,
I come not wholly empty-handed. I bring
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;67]</span>
you something else. On my way here an old-clothes man
offered me twelve shillings for it, but I could not force
myself to part from it. You can sell it, though, if you
want to.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What is it?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Let us see it. (<i>Takes the canvas and unrolls
it. Visibly rejoiced.</i>) Oh, by God, it's Lulu's portrait!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Screaming.</i>) Monster, you brought that
here? Get it out of my sight! Throw it out of the
window!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Suddenly with renewed life, deeply pleased.</i>)
Why, I should like to know? Looking on this picture I
regain my self-respect. It makes my fate comprehensible
to me. Everything we have endured gets clear as day.
(<i>In a somewhat elegiac strain.</i>) Let him who feels secure
in his middle-class position when he sees these blossoming
pouting lips, these child-eyes, big and innocent,
this rose-white body abounding in life,&mdash;let him cast the
first stone at us!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> We must nail it up. It will make an
excellent impression on our patrons.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Energetic.</i>) There's a nail sticking all ready
for it in the wall.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> But how did you come upon this acquisition?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> I secretly cut it out of the wall in your
house, there, after you were gone.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Too bad the color's got rubbed off round the
edges. You didn't roll it up carefully enough. (<i>Fastens
it to a high nail in the wall.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> It's got to have another one underneath
if it's going to hold. It makes the whole flat look more
elegant.
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;68]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Let me alone; I know how I'll do it. (<i>He
tears several nails out of the wall, pulls off his left boot,
and with its heel nails the edges of the picture to the
wall.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> It's just got to hang a while again, to get
its proper effect. Whoever looks at that'll imagine afterwards
he's been in an Indian harem.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Putting on his boot again, standing up
proudly.</i>) Her body was at its highest point of development
when that picture was painted. The lamp, kid
dear! Seems to me it's got extraordinarily dark.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> He must have been an eminently gifted
artist who painted that!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Perfectly composed again, stepping before
the picture with the lamp.</i>) Didn't you know him, then?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> No. It must have been long before my
time. I only occasionally heard chance remarks of yours,
that he had cut his throat from persecution-mania.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Comparing the picture with Lulu.</i>) The
child-like expression in the eyes is still absolutely the
same in spite of all she has lived thru since. (<i>In joyous
excitement.</i>) The dewy freshness that covered her skin,
the sweet-smelling breath from her lips, the rays of
light that beam from her white forehead, and this challenging
splendor of young flesh in throat and arms&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> All that's gone with the rubbish wagon.
She can say with self-assurance: That was me once! The
man she falls into the hands of to-day 'll have no conception
of what we were when we were young.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Cheerfully.</i>) God be thanked, we don't
notice the continual decline when we see a person all the
time. (<i>Lightly.</i>) The woman blooms for us in the
<a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;69]</span>
moment when she hurls the man to destruction for the
rest of his life. That is her nature and her destiny.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Down in the street-lamp's shimmer she's
still a match for a dozen walking spectres. The man
who still wants to make connections at this hour looks
out more for heart-qualities than mere physical good
points. He decides for the pair of eyes from which the
least thievery sparkles.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Now as pleased as Alva.</i>) I shall see if
you're right. Adieu.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>In sudden anger.</i>) You shall not go down
again, as I live!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Where do you want to go?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Down to fetch up a man.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Lulu!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> She's done it once to-day already.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Lulu, Lulu, where you go I go too.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> If you want to put your bones up for
sale, kindly get a district of your own!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> Lulu, I shall not stir from your side! I
have weapons upon me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Confound it all, her ladyship plots to
fish with our bait!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You're killing me. I can't stand it here any
more. (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> You need fear nothing. I am with you.
(<i>Follows her.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> (<i>Whimpering, throws himself on his couch.
Schigolch swears, loudly and grumbling.</i>) I guess there's
not much more good to expect on this side!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> We ought to have held the creature back
by the throat. She'll scare away everything that breathes
with her aristocratic death's head.
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;70]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> She's flung me onto a sick-bed and larded me
with thorns outside and in!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> And she's still got enough strength in
her body to do the same for ten men alright.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> No mortally wounded man'll ever find the
stab of mercy welcomer than I!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> If she hadn't enticed the acrobat to my
place that time, we'd have him round our necks to-day
too.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I see it swinging above my head as Tantalus
saw the branch with the golden apples!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>On his mattress.</i>) Won't you turn up
the lamp a little?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> Can a simple, natural man in the wilderness
suffer so unspeakably?!&mdash;God, God, what have I made of
my life!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What's the beastly weather made of my
ulster! When I was five-and-twenty, I knew how to
help myself!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> It has not cost everyone my sunny, glorious
youth!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I guess it'll go out in a minute. Till
they come back it'll be as dark in here again as in mother's
womb.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> With the clearest consciousness of my purpose
I sought intercourse with people who'd never read a
book in their lives. With self-denial, with exaltation,
I clung to the elements, that I might be carried to the
loftiest heights of poetic fame. The reckoning was false.
I am the martyr of my calling. Since the death of my
father I have not written a single line!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> If only they haven't stayed together!
Nobody but a silly boy will go with two, no matter what.
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;71]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> They've not stayed together!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> That's what I hope. If need be, she'll
keep the creature off from her with kicks.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> One, risen from the dregs, is the most celebrated
man of his nation; another, born in the purple,
lies in the mud and cannot die!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Here they come!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> And what blessed hours of mutual joy in
creation they had lived thru with each other!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> They can do that now, for the first time
rightly.&mdash;We must hide again.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I stay here.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Just what do you pity them for?&mdash;Who
spends his money has his good reasons for it!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">ALVA.</span> I have no longer the moral courage to let my
comfort be disturbed for a miserable sum of money! (<i>He
wraps himself up in his plaid.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Noblesse oblige! A respectable man does
what he owes his position. (<i>He hides, left. Lulu opens
the door, saying &ldquo;Come right in, dearie,&rdquo; and there
enters Prince Kungu Poti, heir-apparent of Uahubee, in
a light suit, white spats, tan button-boots, and a gray tall
hat. His speech, interrupted with frequent hiccoughs,
abounds with the peculiar African hiss-sounds.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> God damn&mdash;it's dark on the stairs!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> It's lighter here, sweetheart. (<i>Pulling him
forward by the hand.</i>) Come on!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> But it's cold here, awful cold!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Have some brandy?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> Brandy? You bet&mdash;always! Brandy's
good!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Giving him the bottle.</i>) I don't know where
there's a glass.
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;72]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> Doesn't matter. (<i>Drinks.</i>) Brandy!
Lots of it!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You're a nice-looking young man.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> My father's the emperor of Uahubee.
I've got six wives here, two Spanish, two English, two
French. Well&mdash;I don't like my wives. Always I must
take a bath, take a bath, take a bath....
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> How much will you give me?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> Gold! Trust me, you shall have gold!
One gold-piece. I always give gold-pieces.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You can give it to me later, but show it to me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> I never pay beforehand.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> But you can show it to me, thoh!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> Don't understand, don't understand!
Come, Ragapsishimulara! (<i>Seizing Lulu round the
waist.</i>) Come on!

<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Defending herself with all her strength.</i>)
Let me be! Let me be! (<i>Alva, who has risen painfully
from his couch, sneaks up to Kungu Poti from behind
and pulls him back by the collar.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">KUNGU POTI.</span> (<i>Whirling round.</i>) Oh! Oh! This
is a murder-hole! Come, my friend, I'll put you to
sleep! (<i>Strikes him over the head with a loaded cane.
Alva groans and falls in a heap.</i>) Here's a sleeping-draught!
Here's opium for you! Sweet dreams to you!
Sweet dreams! (<i>Then he gives Lulu a kiss; pointing
to Alva.</i>) He dreams of you, Ragapsishimulara! Sweet
dreams! (<i>Rushing to the door.</i>) Here's the door!!
(<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> But I'll not stay here?!&mdash;Who can stand it
here now!&mdash;Rather down onto the street! (<i>Exit. Schigolch
comes out.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span>&mdash;Blood!&mdash;Alva!&mdash;He's got to be put away
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;73]</span>
somewhere. Hop!&mdash;Or else our friends 'll get a shock
from him&mdash;Alva! Alva!&mdash;He that isn't quite clear about
it&mdash;! One thing or t'other; or it'll soon be too late!
I'll give him legs! (<i>Strikes a match and sticks it into
Alva's collar....</i>) He will have his rest. But no
one sleeps here.&mdash;(<i>Drags him by the head into Lulu's
room. Returning, he tries to turn up the light.</i>) It'll
be time for me, too, right soon now, or they'll get no
more Christmas puddings down there in the tavern. God
knows when she'll be coming back from her pleasure tour!
(<i>Fixing an eye on Lulu's picture.</i>) She doesn't understand
business! She can't live off love, because her life
is love.&mdash;There she comes. I'll just talk straight to her
once&mdash;(<i>Countess Geschwitz enters.</i>) ... If you want to
lodge with us to-night, kindly take a little care that nothing
is stolen here.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> How dark it is here!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> It gets much darker than this.&mdash;The
doctor's already gone to rest.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> She sent me ahead.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">SCHIGOLCH.</span> That was sensible.&mdash;If anyone asks for
me, I'm sitting downstairs in the pub.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>After he has gone.</i>) I will sit behind
the door. I will look on at everything and not quiver
an eye-lash. (<i>Sits on the broken chair.</i>) Men and
women don't know themselves&mdash;they know not what they
are. Only one who is neither man nor woman knows
them. Every word they say is untrue, a lie. And they
do not know it, for they are to-day so and to-morrow
so, according as they have eaten, drunk, and loved, or not.
Only the body remains for a time what it is, and only
the children have reason. The men and women are like
the animals: none knows what it does. When they are
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;74]</span>
happiest they bewail themselves and groan, and in their
deepest misery they rejoice over every tiny morsel. It is
strange how hunger takes from men and women the
strength to withstand misfortune. But when they have
fed full they make this world a torture-chamber, they
throw away their lives to satisfy a whim, a mood. Have
there ever once been men and women to whom love
brought happiness? And what is their happiness, save
that they sleep better and can forget it all? My God,
I thank thee that thou hast not made me as these. I am
not man nor woman. My body has nothing common
with their bodies. Have I a human soul? Tortured
humanity has a little narrow heart; but I know I deserve
nothing when I resign all, sacrifice all.... (<i>Lulu opens
the door, and Dr. Hilti enters. Geschwitz, unnoticed,
remains motionless by the door.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Gaily.</i>) Come right in! Come!&mdash;you'll stay
with me all night?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> (<i>His accent is very broad and flat.</i>) But
I have no more than five shillings on me. I never take
more than that when I go out.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> That's enough, because it's you! You have
such faithful eyes! Come, give me a kiss! (<i>Dr. Hilti
begins to swear, in the broadest north-country vowels.</i>)
Please, don't say that.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> By the de'il, 'tis the first time I've e'er
gone with a girrl! You can believe me. Mass, I hadn't
thought it would be like this!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Are you married?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> Heaven and Hail, why do you think I am
married?&mdash;No, I'm a tutor; I read philosophy at the
University. The truth is, I come of a very old country
family. As a student, I got just two shillings pocket-money,
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
and I could make better use of that than for
girrls!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> So you have never been with a woman?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> Just so, yes! But I want it now. I got
engaged this evening to a country-woman of mine. She's
a governess here.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Is she pretty?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> Yaw, she's got a hundred thousand.&mdash;I
am very eager, as it seems to me....
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Tossing back her hair.</i>) I <span class="gesperrt">am</span> in luck!
(<i>Takes the lamp.</i>) Well, if you please, Mr. Tutor?
(<i>They go into her room. Geschwitz draws a small black
revolver from her pocket and sets it to her forehead.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span>&mdash;Come, come,&mdash;beloved! (<i>Dr. Hilti tears
open the door again.&mdash;</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> (<i>Plunging in.</i>) Insane seraphs! Some
one's lying in there!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Lamp in hand, holds him by the sleeve.</i>)
Stay with me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> A dead man! A corpse!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Stay with me! Stay with me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> (<i>Tearing away.</i>) A corpse is lying in
there! Horrors! Hail! Heaven!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Stay with me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> Where d's it go out? (<i>Sees Geschwitz.</i>)
And there is the devil!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Please, stop, stay!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">DR. HILTI.</span> Devil, devilled devilry!&mdash;Oh, thou eternal&mdash;(<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Rushing after him.</i>) Stop! Stop!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Alone, lets the revolver sink.</i>) Better,
hang! If she sees me lie in my blood to-day she'll not
weep a tear for me! I have always been to her but
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
the docile tool that could be used for the heaviest labor.
From the first day she has abhorred me from the depths
of her soul.&mdash;Shall I not rather jump from the bridge?
Which could be colder, the water or her heart? I would
dream till I was drowned.&mdash;Better, hang!&mdash; &mdash;Stab?&mdash;Hm,
there would be no use in that&mdash; &mdash;How often have I
dreamt that she kissed me! But a minute more; an owl
knocks there at the window, and I wake up.&mdash; &mdash;Better,
hang! Not water; water is too clean for me. (<i>Starting
up.</i>) There!&mdash;There! There it is!&mdash;Quick now, before
she comes! (<i>Takes the plaid-straps from the wall, climbs
on the chair, fastens them to a hook in the door-post, puts
her head thru them, kicks the chair away, and falls to the
ground.</i>) Accursed life!&mdash;Accursed life!&mdash;Could it be before
me still??&mdash;Let me speak just once to thy heart, my
angel! But thou art cold!&mdash;I am not to go yet! Perhaps
I am even to have been happy once.&mdash;Listen to him,
Lulu! I am not to go yet! (<i>She drags herself before
Lulu's picture, sinks to her knees and folds her hands.</i>)
My ador&eacute;d angel! My love! My star!&mdash;Have mercy
upon me, pity me, pity me, pity me!
</p>
<p>
(<i>Lulu opens the door, and Jack enters&mdash;a thick-set
man of elastic movements, with a pale face, inflamed eyes,
arched and heavy brows, a drooping mustache, thin imperial
and shaggy whiskers, and fiery red hands with
gnawed nails. His eyes are fixed on the ground. He
wears a dark overcoat and a little round felt hat. Entering,
he notices Geschwitz.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Who is that?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> That's my sister. She's crazy. I don't know
how to get rid of her.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Your mouth looks beautiful.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> It's my mother's.
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Looks like it. How much do you want? I
haven't got much money.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Won't you spend the night with me here?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> No, haven't got the time. I must get home.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> You can tell them at home to-morrow that
you missed the last 'bus and spent the night with a friend.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> How much do you want?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I'm not after lumps of gold, but, well, a little
something.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> (<i>Turning.</i>) Good night! Good night!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Holds him back.</i>) No, no! Stay, for God's
sake!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> (<i>Goes past Geschwitz and opens the cubicle.</i>)
Why should I stay here till morning? Sounds suspicious!
When I'm asleep they'll turn my pockets out.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> No, I won't do that! No one will! Don't
go away again for that! I beg you!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> How much do you want?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Then give me the half of what I said!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> No, that's too much. You don't seem to have
been at this long?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> To-day is the first time. (<i>She jerks back
Geschwitz, on her knees still, half turned toward Jack,
by the straps around her neck.</i>) Lie down and be quiet!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Let her alone! She isn't your sister. She is
in love with you. (<i>Strokes Geschwitz's head like a dog's.</i>)
Poor beast!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Why do you stare at me so all at once?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> I got your measure by the way you walked.
I said to myself: That girl must have a well-built body.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> How can you see things like that?
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> I even saw that you had a pretty mouth. But
I've only got a florin on me.
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> Well, what difference does that make! Just
give that to me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> But you'll have to give me half back, so I can
take the 'bus to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I have nothing on me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Just look, thoh. Hunt thru your pockets!&mdash;Well,
what's that? Let's see it!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Showing him.</i>) That's all I have.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Give it to me!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> I'll change it to-morrow, and then give you
half.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> No, give it all to me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Giving it.</i>) In God's name! But now you
come! (<i>Takes up the lamp.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> We need no light. The moon's out.
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Puts the lamp down.</i>) As you say. (<i>She
falls on his neck.</i>) I won't harm you at all! I love you
so! Don't let me beg you any longer!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Alright; I'm with you. (<i>Follows her into the
cubby-hole. The lamp goes out. On the floor under the
two sky-lights appear two vivid squares of moonlight.
Everything in the room is clearly seen.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>As in a dream.</i>) This is the last evening
I shall spend with these people. I'm going back to
Germany. My mother'll send me the money. I'll go to
a university. I must fight for woman's rights; study
law.... (<i>Lulu shrieks, and tears open the door.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Barefoot, in chemise and petticoat, holding
the door shut behind her.</i>) Help!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Rushes to the door, draws her revolver,
and pushing Lulu aside, aims it at the door. As Lulu
again cries &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</i>) Let go! (<i>Jack, bent double, tears
open the door from inside, and runs a knife into Geschwitz's</i>
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
<i>body. She fires one shot, at the roof, and falls
with suppressed crying, crumpling up. Jack tears her
revolver from her and throws himself against the exit-door.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> God damn! I never saw a prettier mouth!
(<i>Sweat drips from his hairy face. His hands are bloody.
He pants, gasping violently, and stares at the floor with
eyes popping out of his head. Lulu, trembling in every
limb, looks wildly round. Suddenly she seizes the bottle,
smashes it on the table, and with the broken neck in
her hand rushes upon Jack. He swings up his right foot
and throws her onto her back. Then he lifts her up.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> No, no!&mdash;Mercy!&mdash;Murder!&mdash;Police! Police!
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> Be still. You'll never get away from me again.
(<i>Carries her in.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">LULU.</span> (<i>Within, right.</i>) No!&mdash;No!&mdash;No!&mdash; &mdash;Ah!&mdash;Ah!...
</p>
<p>
(<i>After a pause, Jack re-enters. He puts the bowl
on the table.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">JACK.</span> That <span class="gesperrt">was</span> a piece of work! (<i>Washing his
hands.</i>) I <span class="gesperrt">am</span> a damned lucky chap! (<i>Looks round
for a towel.</i>) Not even a towel, these folks here! Hell of
a wretched hole! (<i>He dries his hands on Geschwitz's petticoat.</i>)
This invert is safe enough from me! (<i>To her.</i>)
It'll soon be all up with you, too. (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="allsmcap">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Alone.</i>) Lulu!&mdash;My angel!&mdash;Let me
see thee once more! I am near thee&mdash;stay near thee&mdash;forever!
(<i>Her elbows give way.</i>) O cursed&mdash;!!
